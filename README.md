# VBA-Excel
Assignment 2
In this assignment, I used VBA to loop through all the stocks for one year and each worksheet to show the following:
1)Ticker 
2)Yearly change 
3)Percentage change 
4)Total stock volume of the stock 
5)Greatest % increase 
6)Greatest % decrease 
7)Greatest total volume 
10)Conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green 
11)Conditional formatting to show percentage changes
The Excel File was too big to upload, so only screenshots were attached.
